  <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

 <h1>Who Are We</h1>
 <p>
I started shooting weddings in 2005. Back then all I did was record what happened. I learned over the years that there was much more to be done. Who is this couple? Why is everyone so happy for them? The work needed to be different. That’s when I changed from making Videos to making Films in 2011. It became less about the things or what was happening and became more about the people. Businesses, products, and organizations are the same way. They’re about the people. They’re about making a connection. And frankly, telling that brand story is what is important. What most people need is not marketing or branding, it’s getting to the heart of who you are and sharing that heart with the world.
The reason I called the company Cinema Couture is that every film has its own personality. Every wedding couple wants their story told a little differently. Every event is about something. Every product or business is unique. I understand how to find that story and customize a film that reflects your true personality.</p>
