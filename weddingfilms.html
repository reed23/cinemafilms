                  <h1>Feature Films</h1>
                  <p>We take all of the elements of your wedding day and create a short film that is engaging, exciting and tells your story; the way it should be told. We use our vast experience with weddings to find those stories and the storytellers are in your life. There is no more complete way of capturing who you are at this time in your life and preserving history. Notice how much you get to know the couples in these films. We are not just documenting your wedding day. We’re making a wedding film…</p>

    <h1>Who are you</h1>
 <p>Your friends and family think you’re great together. You have dogs that you raise like children. You laugh more together than when you’re apart. We look for couples that are madly in love. They have this crazy world swirling around them and all they want is to be married to each other. It’s a pretty simple and classic story really. We look for those great relationships in your life. Those people that have brought you together. The ups and downs of a wedding day make for great storytelling. Your story deserves to be told. Let’s tell it.</p>

   <h1>OUR EXPERTISE</h1>
I’ve been in the wedding business for over 10 years. That means I’ve seen almost everything, and can make a great wedding film in every scenario.
I’ve worked in restrictive churches, in the pouring rain, on beaches with 20 mph winds, and absolutely nothing phases me. Working with us is so easy and comfortable, it’s like we’re old friends.

  <h1>OUR COMMITMENT</h1>
I have a singular commitment: you will love your film!
Our team makes it our commitment, whether it’s in production on the wedding day or in editing weeks after that your film must be right.
I bring all of my years of technical expertise as well as experience with hundreds of couples to bringing you a film that’s right for you. And we stop at nothing to make sure it’s the best that it can be. Ask any couple that’s worked with us, and they will tell you what it has meant to them.
