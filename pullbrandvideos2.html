                  <p>My favorite thing is listening to why you do things, watching your face light up and your voice change as you get excited about what you’re doing,  telling the world who you are and explaining your purpose. This isn’t marketing. This is focusing your brand story so it’s engaging, entertaining, visually beautiful, and makes an impact on the audience. Your brand story isn’t just about what you do, it’s about who you are and why…</p>

    <p><h1>  WHO ARE YOU? </h1>
You know that right now ROI is about connection.
You love what you do and know that if you could connect with your potential clients, tell your brand story and stay connected with your current clients, that your revenue will grow and flourish.
You know that traditional advertising is in decline and what people are about right now is brand stories.
You believe passionately in what you do and you believe that the world should know about it.</p>

  <p><h1>WHO ARE WE? </h1>
We are Cinema Couture. Our goal is for you to reach your audience.
The key to that is the way we tell your brand story. The film should be beautiful, meaningful, and should hit your potential audience in the heart.
Our process starts with getting to know you and what you’re about. We want to understand why you’re here and what you would want to tell the world if you had a chance. Then once we have this amazing video that you really believe in, we help you figure out how to share it with the world and make the most of the few minutes of attention you can get from people.
Couture means custom made. We specialize in brand storytelling. That is who we are.</p>

   <h1>WHO DO WE WORK BEST WITH?</h1><p>
Our process isn’t for everyone.
We want clients that don’t have to hide behind marketing speak and statistics. We want clients that are focused on the long game and interested in building a great marketing foundation.
We work very well with non-profits because of the wealth of stories they have. But we also love working with small businesses that have a great foundation of passion and hard work to tell the world about.</p>

  <div class="col span_1_of_2 greyme">
   <p><h1>HOW MUCH SHOULD I BUDGET FOR THIS?</h1>
Our films start at $1500 and it depends completely on how many shoot days it takes us to get the story. On average our clients invest $3000 on their film.</p>
